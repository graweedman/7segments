**--Project--**

Project performed on STM32F3Discovery Chip
MCU: STM32F303VCTx

A Project where the 4x7 segment is tested using potentiometer.

Connecting potentiometer to ADC1 Input and outputing the value on 4 digit 7 segment display.

My discovery was that multiple digit 7 segment displays blink each digit seperately really fast making it look like its displaying 4 digits instead of 1.


-- Future Plans --

Make potentiometer control the speed of on-board LED array blinking using Timers.
